This is going to be hell. Ignore this for as long as possible.

Ok, so, here's how the UI's gonna go down. I'm gonna keep the placeholder detail text as a guide, when you hit a page button, it'll go to the next page and change what's displayed on the buttons, the buttons either do nothing but look pretty, or will open up a little box of equip, sell, yada yada. Gonna have to come up with a way to mark equipped items for party and player as well

Each item will probably have to be assigned a unique number and that's gonna tell the game what's equipped
Wait, no need, if I make the items functions, it'll change in there

Tabs will change what's being shown to their pages

Use equip indicators to well, indicate equipment

Inventory Completion:

Tabs, Buttons that should go to next page, Layout

Things to do:

Display item stats, actually equip items
Figure out how to make an inventory system that doesn't rely on picking up items in a 3d space
