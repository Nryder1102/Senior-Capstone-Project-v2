How party member stats should work:

Three stat values for each character slot
Each slot's values will be set to equal the selected values depending on which character fills that slot

Basically, if party member 2 = (character)
statsp1 = (character's stats)

This is going to be really annoying
Like, REALLY annoying, as I have to repeat each character's stats per slot
This is going to be SO many variables

Variable count as of 2/6/2021: 50
^ It's not done yet either

After confirming stat increases to party member, it would go opposite, party member's stats now equal statsp#

FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO PARTY MEMBER EQUIPMENT STATS TOO!!!

As a matter of fact, figure out how to do player equipment as well!

... Figure out how to do party level ups as well...

Alright, so, player stat saving is done, at least during a single run, need to figure out a way to save through exiting

Next up, party members stat distrubution and actually making the stats for the members/monsters. Why do you do this to yourself?
