Player will learn this throughout the game as they remember and learn

Destiny/Fate is 100% screwing with them no matter what

Iskaed is important, everyone in the dungeon protects him

??? is an unknown, maybe related to destiny/fate interference, but probably not

Story ideas: 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Fates called for one hero to unite everyone against a big bad, got 6, made wars worse, left cleanup to ???, ??? called for the player

Pros: 

Cons: 
Where does the dungeon and monsters come in, as well as the player being there?


----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) The 6 heroes are corrupt, each leading their race towards eventual extinction via wars against the monsters, Fates messed up, left ??? the mess, and ??? went and got the player as an agent to work through

Player either ends the wars by killing the big bad of the dungeon, or takes out the heroes and has everyone live in peace. Or just goes through the dungeon to get out of it and then ignores everything else

Heroes = Bad, they messed up, and killed a lot of monsters for power, starting this whole thing off, history doesn't remember it this way

Pros:

Cons:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Basically a mix of 1 and 2, fates messed up by accidentally calling 6 heroes, they made things worse, have become corrupt, left cleanup to ???, ??? called the player to be the BBEG to unite the heroes against, either by themselves, or with the help of monsters, or just sort of doesn't care

Pros:
Brings dungeon into the loop, as well as motivation to kill/befriend monsters

Cons: 
I'll think of some
